# Breakout
I made an actual game in python for the first time! It's a breakout clone...

This project is the result of learning how to do class in inheritance, how to have multiple scenes in one game, and other stuff. I did run into a couple problems with writing this program but using what I know, I mananged to come up with solutions to it. The game seems to run fine on the computer I'm using, I'm not sure about everyone else.

To play the game, all you have to is run the .exe or the .py file. You do need to have pygame installed to run the .py though.

It's breakout, pretty self explanatory on how to play it. Use the arrow keys to move left and right, try to hit the ball into the blocks, destroy the all blocks to 'win'. I have to admit, this is a pretty crappy port of breakout. The ball is slow. If I were to increase the speed, then it would break of the ball boucing collision works and I also can't seem to figure out how to make it so that the ball speed increases every time it breaks a block, so I made the player really short to compensate.

Nethertheless, it is my game and I made it. I would really appreciate it if you were to try it out. I don't really care what you do with it.
